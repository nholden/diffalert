## Installation

```
git clone git://github.com/nholden/diffalert
cd diffalert
brew install redis postgresql heroku
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:reset
cp .env.example .env
```

## Getting started

```
heroku local
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5081 (or whichever port you choose in `.env`), click "sign up," and create an account. Click "add trigger," and follow the prompts to begin receiving alerts on any file in a GitHub repository for which you have access to manage webhooks.

If youâ€™re running DiffAlert locally, youâ€™ll need to make your server accessible to the internet so that GitHub webhooks are able to access DiffAlert's endpoint. Consider a service like [Forward](https://forwardhq.com/). Otherwise, try deploying DiffAlert to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free.

Slack alerts will work out of the box with [a new incoming Slack webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/). Email alerts are sent by Mailgun. Sign up for a free account at [mailgun.com](http://www.mailgun.com). Youâ€™ll need to update `.env` to reflect your Mailgun credentials. Unless the `RELEASE_STAGE` environment variable is set to `"production"`, all emails will be intercepted and sent to the email specified by the `NON_PRODUCTION_SEND_TO` environment variable.

Slack and email alerts are sent in the background by [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq). You can monitor Sidekiq via the web UI at http://localhost:5081/sidekiq. When you deploy DiffAlert to a production environment, the Sidekiq web UI will be protected by HTTP Basic authentication. Youâ€™ll need to set the `SIDEKIQ_USERNAME` and `SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD` environment variables in order to access the Sidekiq web UI in production.

## Testing

```
bundle exec rake
```
