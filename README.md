# ðŸš¨  DiffAlert

Get email or Slack alerts when specific files in your GitHub repositories change

## Demo

Try it out for yourself at [http://diffalert.nickholden.io](http://diffalert.nickholden.io).

## Installation

```
git clone git://github.com/nholden/diffalert
cd diffalert
bundle install

bundle exec rake db:reset
cp .env.example .env
```

## Getting started

```
rails s
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5081 (or whichever port you choose in `.env`), click "sign up," and create an account. Click "add trigger," and follow the prompts to begin receiving alerts on any file in a GitHub repository for which you have access to manage webhooks.

If youâ€™re running DiffAlert locally, youâ€™ll need to make your server accessible to the internet so that GitHub webhooks are able to access DiffAlert's endpoint. Consider a service like [Forward](https://forwardhq.com/). Otherwise, try deploying DiffAlert to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free.

Slack alerts will work out of the box with [a new incoming Slack webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/). Email alerts are sent by Mailgun. Sign up for a free account at [mailgun.com](http://www.mailgun.com). Youâ€™ll need to update `.env` to reflect your Mailgun credentials.

## Testing

```
bundle exec rake
```
